Hold this position briefly and make sure you have complete control of the bar. Now raise the bar up to the starting postion.  Return the bar to the rack after you've completed your set.",
        "tips": "The width of your grip on the bar will change the focus of the bench press. A medium grip is most common. This is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. It's usually marked on the bar.  Having a spotter to help you with the bench press is essential. A competitive, motivating spotter is one of the most valuable assets you can find.  Choose a weight that is challenging and allows you to maintain proper form. Improper form is less effective and could result in an injury. Use a slow controlled motion and never lock your elbows.",

While holding the bar, start the lift by pushing with your legs while simultaneously getting your torso to the upright position as you breathe out. In the upright position, stick your chest out and contract the back by bringing the shoulder blades back. Think of how the soldiers in the military look when they are in standing in attention. 4. Go back to the starting position by bending at the knees while simultaneously leaning the torso forward at the waist while keeping the back straight. When the weights on the bar touch the floor you are back at the starting position and ready to perform another repetition. 5. Perform the amount of repetitions prescribed in the program.",

Keep the bar as close to you as possible – almost roll it up your shins until you get to your knees, and then almost roll it up your thighs until you’re upright. As you bring it past your knees, don’t think about pulling up with your back, thrust in with your hips. Keep your head up and chest out as you lift - this will help you keep your back aligned properly. As you bring the weight up, you want your legs to straighten out simultaneously as your hips come in completely - form a straight line at the same time with your hips, knees and feet.",

Start with your arms holding dumbbells about an inch higher than your chest. The dumbbells should be in line with the middle of your chest so that your arms are comfortably out to the sides.  Slowly push the dumbbells up. Focus on using your chest and triceps to push most of the weight. Stop when your arms are straight and the dumbbells are directly above your chest. Don't clank the dumbbells together or spin them around when you get to the top.  Next, slowly lower the dumbbells. Don't let gravity do the work. You should be resisting gravity all the way down. The rep ends when the dumbbells are back to 1 inch above your chest.",
        "tips": "Breathe comfortably and deeply. Especially while you're pushing the dumbbells up.",

As you bring it past your knees, don’t think about pulling up with your back, thrust in with your hips. Keep your head up and chest out as you lift - this will help you keep your back aligned properly.

Slowly push the dumbbells up. Focus on using your chest and triceps to push most of the weight. Stop when your arms are straight and the dumbbells are directly above your chest. Don't clank the dumbbells together or spin them around when you get to the top.  Next, slowly lower the dumbbells. Don't let gravity do the work. You should be resisting gravity all the way down. The rep ends when the dumbbells are back to 1 inch above your chest.",
